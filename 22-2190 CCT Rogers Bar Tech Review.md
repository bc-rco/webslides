# Summary
- Planning project for future development of Rogers Bar on Lake Roosevelt, for a recreational boat camping area
- Rogers bar is located 20 miles south of the town of Inchelium
- 2-300 acre site has been a camping and recreation area for 60+ years
- Motor boating, water skiing, swimming, fishing, camping, and hiking
- Remote area of the Colville Indian Reservation, will be accessed primarily by boaters, especially who are spending multiple days on the water

# Criteria 1: Need
- This is an area of critical need
- Local socioeconomic / demographic factors
- Importance of tourism to economy
- Few other options, remote location: desirable for recreation tourists, and special opportunity for local access
- Unmanaged sites are damaged by improper use, inadequate facilities
- Rare opportunity for boat-based camping
- Access to area for cultural practices and lifeways

# Criteria 2: Site Suitability
- Already part of tribal lands, intended for this use, and currently being used for boat camping
- Rare, epic beaches are some of the nicest in state
- Deep inlets create much more linear beach length than other sites, and protect cove area from wind

# Criteria 5: Planning Success
- CCT has strong planning department, with robust practices, and close partnership with architecture partners
- 30 years of planning grants with RCO
- Two recent BFP planning grants, with Keller Ferry Launch development completed and Nicholson Beach planned for 2024

# Criteria 6: Sustainability
- This is a key factor in intent and design
- Purpose of project is to improve sustainability and usability of site, to improve user experience while reducing current environmental impacts
- Focus will be on waste management, erosion reduction, fire prevention, and so on

# Criteria 7: Cost-benefit
- Majority of land is already owned, approved for future recreational use
- More "beach per buck"
- Efficient planning costs
- Will eventually result in massive recreational benefit of 300 acre site
- Economic and cultural benefits will bring additional value to tribes

# Criteria 8: Boats on Trailers
- Yes, this will primarily be for boats on trailers
- Launching from other sites, coming here by boat to camp
- Launch development considered for future phases

# Criteria 9: Boating Experience
- This area can provide a world-class boating experience!
- The lake is exceptional, the camping will be lovely
- And beach camping from a boat is a special experience, even for long-time boaters and campers
- Area is already desired and used by boaters, and this will make it all the better
- Traditional use since time immemorial, opportunity for tribes to connect with visitors experientially - help them get a glimpse of why the area is so important to tribes, to be cherished and protected.
- Boating there is really, ***really*** fun!
